# AppTimeTracker

Small personal project.
I like hour-tracking of Steam so and I wanted to have similar utility for my dev work to keep 
myself more motivated (I like growing numbers!).  
  
Other solutions were not as private or tailored to my needs (this is only a Python script with local SQLite DB). 

TODO:  
- [ ] Make it work as systemd deamon  
- [ ] Make cooler reports  
- [ ] Make it more configurable
